# CellMonitoringServer

It's the source code of the server that provides to iOS CellMonitoring App all information about wireless network topology and cells KPIs.

Quick source descriptions:
- GenerateLocalizationData is a tool that can generate a network topology based on input files (like OpenCellId but others are supported). Generated topology is stored in SQLite database, it may contains several millions of objects
- iMonServer is the server that implements the REST API to extract network topology, KPIs... It's started either in an embedded Tomcat or Jetty based on a configuration file. All communications are HTTPs over HTTP/2
Network topology is extracted from SQLite and KPIs are by default generated by a simulator but coud have been retreived from a remote server
- CommonUtilities is a set of common JAVA classes used by GenerateLocalizationData and iMonServer
